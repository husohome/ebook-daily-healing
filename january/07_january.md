# January 7, 2025 | Root Belief Pruning  
🌞 Capricorn | 🌙 Virgo | 🌓 First Quarter  

## 🌳 Core Stability Practice  

**Practice:**  
□ Root Examination:  
1. Dig up "absolute" statement (e.g., "This must not happen")  
2. Test soil reality: "What evidence supports/disproves this?"  
3. Fertilize new belief: "I can handle different outcomes while staying rooted"  
1. Unearth "always/never" statement (e.g., "This always ruins everything")  
2. Check root health: "When has this not been true?"  
3. Repot belief: "Some conditions challenge me, others don't"
