**Jungian Context:**  
*Cognitive functions are mental processes - Ti=Analytical Logic, Fi=Value Assessment, Te=External Systems, Fe=Social Harmony*  

### Function Flames Guide:  
- **Ti (Introverted Thinking):** Likes systems → Burns through complexity  
- **Fi (Introverted Feeling):** Values authenticity → Burns with passion  
- **Te (Extraverted Thinking):** Organizes externally → Burns efficiently  
- **Fe (Extraverted Feeling):** Connects people → Burns for others
