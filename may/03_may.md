## 🧠 Neuro-Energizing Practice

### Practice
Let's try this:
□ Brain-Body Scan (5 min)
  • Lie down, focus on crown → toes
  • Note tension areas (Journal of Neuroscience, 2023)
  • Imagine oxygenating those zones
  • Breathe into tight spots

### 📝 Scan Notes
Take a moment to reflect:
Where did you hold the most tension?
