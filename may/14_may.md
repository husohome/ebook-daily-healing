2. Have someone guess (or guess yourself!)

### 📝 Mime Notes
Take a moment to reflect:

### 💫 Astrophysical Insight
"93% of communication is non-verbal - your cells 'talk' through quantum vibrations too!" 

**Gesture Examples:**
- Supernova: Explode outward with fingers
- Photosynthesis: Arms as leaves reaching up
- Gravity: Pulling motion toward floor 

**Vitality Boost:**
- Full-body movement increases lymphatic flow 32%
- Cosmic mimicry enhances spatial awareness and oxygen uptake
