### Practice  
Let's try this:  
□ Mental Debris Cleanup (5 min)  
1. Identify "flooding thought" (e.g., "I'll drown in this")  
2. Ask: "What evidence floats against this?"  
3. Craft balanced perspective raft  

| Stormy Thought | Intensity (1-5) | Supporting Evidence | Counter Evidence | Calm Perspective |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|
|                |                  |                      |                  |                  |
