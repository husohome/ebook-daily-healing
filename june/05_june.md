## 🌊 Flow Practice

### Practice
Let's try this:
□ Emotional Wave Exercise (5 min)
1. Visualize emotions as water colors in body
2. Draw their flow path with non-dominant hand
3. Hum at 528Hz (water healing frequency)
4. Release through finger-tip "drips"

### 📝 Current Notes
Where did emotions pool/flow freely?
