## 💧 Story Currents  

### Healing Anecdote  
*A creek once dammed by fallen logs sang:  
"Stagnant I lie, yet remember my flow -  
Each ripple a memory, each pool a hello."  
Children came, moved one log each dawn -  
Now laughter echoes where blockage was drawn.*  

### Practice  
□ Write letter to your "dammed" self  
□ Fold into paper boat → float with 1 affirmation  

### 📝 Flow Notes  
What emotional log could you gently shift?
