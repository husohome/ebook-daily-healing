☀️ Cancer | 🌙 Taurus | 🌔 Waxing Gibbous  

## 🚤 Thought Navigation  

### Practice  
Let's try this:  
□ Lock System Reframe (5 min)  
1. Identify "blocked canal" thought  
2. Chart alternative routes (What else could be true?)  
3. Install cognitive "lock" between old/new channels  

| Obstruction | Alternative Channels | Probability (%) | Preferred Path |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|----------------|
|             |                      |                 |                |
